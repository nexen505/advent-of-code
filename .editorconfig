# IntelliJ allows to export the code style in the .editorconfig format. These are the settings
# from the most recent settings for SquareAndroid from here:
#
# https://github.com/square/java-code-styles
#
# Every time someone changes Square's code style we should update the config here, too. These
# settings override the selected code style. This means nobody needs to import the code style
# anymore and we can change settings for all developers here at once.
#
# Some keys were manually changed:
#   * insert_final_newline (is false, changed to true, expected by KtLint)
#   * ktlint_ignore_back_ticked_identifier (enabled, see comment below)
#   * root (see comment below)

# Tells tools to stop searching upwards.
